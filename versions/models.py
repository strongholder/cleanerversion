        Completely overridden to avoid bulk deletion that happens when the parent method calls clear().

        The parent method's logic is basically: clear all in bulk, then add the given objects in bulk.
        Instead, we figure out which ones are being added and removed, and call add and remove for these values.
        This lets us retain the versioning information.

        also be deleted because they have a ON CASCADE DELETE relationship to the object, or, in the case of
        "Multi-table inheritance", are parent objects.
